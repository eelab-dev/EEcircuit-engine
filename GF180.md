# GF180MCU

To use GF180MCU models, you need to include the model card with a specific process corner.

Available corners:
- `typical`: Typical corner
- `ff`: Fast-Fast corner
- `ss`: Slow-Slow corner
- `fs`: Fast-Slow corner
- `sf`: Slow-Fast corner
- `statistical`: Statistical Variation (Monte Carlo)

Add `.include modelcard.GF180.<corner>` in your netlist. For example:

```plaintext
.include modelcard.GF180.typical
```
or 
```plaintext
.include modelcard.GF180.statistical
```

### Usage Examples

#### Standard 3.3V NMOS (`nmos_3p3`)

This model can be used as a **Subcircuit (X)** or as a **Primitive (M)**.

**1. Subcircuit Usage (Recommended)**
Use the `X` prefix. This includes statistical mismatch parameters (`delvto`) and is required for Monte Carlo mismatch simulations.

```plaintext
* X<name> <Drain> <Gate> <Source> <Bulk> <Model> <Parameters>
X1 d g s b nmos_3p3 w=10u l=0.28u
```

**2. Primitive Usage (Native)**
Use the `M` prefix. This uses the core model directly, bypassing the subcircuit wrapper. It does **not** include the mismatch variations defined in the subcircuit. Use this for simpler simulations or when mismatch is not needed.

```plaintext
* M<name> <Drain> <Gate> <Source> <Bulk> <Model> <Parameters>
M1 d g s b nmos_3p3 w=10u l=0.28u
```

#### 6.0V Native NMOS (`nmos_6p0_nat`)

The `nmos_6p0_nat` is a **Native** (depletion-mode) device, often used for zero-threshold or low-voltage applications.

**1. Subcircuit Usage**
```plaintext
X1 d g s b nmos_6p0_nat w=10u l=1.8u
```

**2. Primitive Usage**
```plaintext
M1 d g s b nmos_6p0_nat w=10u l=1.8u
```

**Difference between `nmos_3p3` and `nmos_6p0_nat`:**
- `nmos_3p3`: Standard enhancement-mode MOSFET. Normally OFF (Vth > 0). Requires positive Vgs to conduct.
- `nmos_6p0_nat`: Native (depletion-like) MOSFET. Lower threshold voltage (often near 0V or slightly negative). Can conduct at very low Vgs. Used in specific analog blocks (e.g., references, low-voltage switches).

#### SAB Models (e.g., `nmos_3p3_sab`)

**SAB** stands for **Salicide Block**. These models represent transistors where the silicide formation is blocked on the drain and/or source regions.

- **Purpose**: Blocking silicide increases the resistance of the diffusion regions. This is primarily used for **ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection** devices to limit current and prevent damage during high-voltage events. It can also be used to create ballast resistors.
- **Model Details**: The `_sab` subcircuits usually include additional resistors at the drain and/or source terminals to model this effect.
- **Parameters**: `s_sab` (Source SAB length) and `d_sab` (Drain SAB length) control the resistance added.
